# Week 4: [Ann-Marie's Dishonor Society](https://helloitsjoe.github.io/weekly-project-club/?page=3)

This week you'll be working with Ann-Marie, the president of her local honor society. Her honor
society meets every week in groups of about 30 people, led by a group leader. The honor society has
two kinds of members, regular members that everybody starts as, and exceptional members.

In order to become an exceptional member someone has to:

- Be a member for at least 2 years
- Do 100 hours of community service
- Be nominated by their group leader
- Be elected by at least 50% of the group.

Currently, Ann-Marie goes to each group and runs an election, doing the whole process manually. Each
member gets a ballot with the list of nominees, and they mark those ballots with who they want to
become an exceptiona memberl. They can mark more than one if they so choose. If 5 people are
nominated all 5 of them can become exceptionals.

Hereâ€™s an example of how an election might go:

Dani, Sarah, and Jimmy all meet criteria 1 and 2. Their group leader nominates them. On the day of
the election, 18 people show up to the group meeting. The group votes and Sarah gets 12 votes, Dani
gets 9 and Jimmy gets 8. Sarah and Dani are now exceptional members, and Jimmy has to try again next
year.

The honor society is getting too large for Ann-Marie to run all of these elections by herself, so
this week build something to help her out! Some useful things would be:

- Easy vote tallying
- Keeping track of new exceptional members in a text file
- Printable ballot generation
- Something online that she can send to group leaders.
