# Week 3: Sweatin' with Seth

This week you'll be working with Seth, a gym teacher. Seth has to run practice for lots of teams,
and he's been doing this for a long time. He always does warm-ups with his teams in exactly the same
way, like he has for the past 30 years. He's noticed that for his current students if he runs warm
up the exact same way every single practice, his students will get bored of them. If they're bored
they won't stretch as well, and then they tend to get hurt more. Seth hasn't had to come up with a
new warmup routine for about 30 years so.....

This week, build Seth a Random Warm Up Routine Generator.

A warm up consists of an activity and an amount. An activity would be jumping jacks or squats, and
an amount is the number times they do that activity (so 10 jumping jacks or 12 squats). For the
activities that Seth knows, he figures 1 activity takes about 2 seconds (so 10 jumping jacks would
take 20 seconds, and 12 squats would take about 24 seconds). Warmups should take about 3 minutes
(but really anywhere between 2:30 and 3:30 is fine).

For example, a warm up routine could be:

- 28 Jumping Jacks
- 17 squats
- 13 lunges
- 20 planks
- 6 arm reaches
- Totaling 168 seconds or 2:48

Here's a list of the 10 warm ups to pull from, but feel free to use others you can find:

Try and keep some variety, at least 4 different activities per warm up, but probably no more
than 20.

If you want to go the extra mile, here's some feature ideas:

- Mark an activity as 'boring' and skip it for the next week or two
- Add a new exercise without a code change.
- Format things nicely so Seth can print however many out in the morning to have ready.
- Don't forget to warm up your programming muscles by planning out your week here, and you can
  always call foul and submit a help request here.
